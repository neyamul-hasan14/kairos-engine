# 🔮 Project Kairos

A futuristic time travel social network platform that connects travelers across different timelines. Built with PHP and modern web technologies.

## 🌟 The Story

In the year 2085, Scientist Kazi Neyamul Hasan, a brilliant computer scientist and engineer, dared to chase the impossible — time travel. His invention, called Kairos, would become the gateway to humanity's future.

But he didn't build it alone.

From the distant galaxy Messier 87 came a peaceful alien species known as the Imaginners — luminous, thoughtful beings who believed in the power of human creativity. They found something special in Kazi… and offered to help.

Together, they unlocked secrets of space and time, blending human engineering with alien knowledge. Kairos was born — a shimmering engine capable of bending reality itself.
